# TozStore Vue Sample App

## Notes
This project is a very basic example of how to use Vue and TozStore together.  Note that this
project does not include any CSP which should be in place in any production application. In general this repository is not production ready as is, but is an example for how to build a production Vue Application that uses TozStore for end-to-end encrypted data management.
